	abstract = {Context: Stellar clusters are benchmarks for theories of star formation and evolution. The high precision parallax data of the Gaia mission allows significant improvements in the distance determination to stellar clusters and its stars. In order to have accurate and precise distance determinations, systematics like the parallax spatial correlations need to be accounted for, especially for stars in small sky regions. Aims: Provide the astrophysical community with a free and open code designed to simultaneously infer cluster parameters (i.e. distance and size) and the distances to its stars using Gaia parallax measurements. It includes cluster oriented prior families and is specifically designed to deal with the Gaia parallax spatial correlations. Methods: A Bayesian hierarchical model is created to allow the inference of both the cluster parameters and distances to its stars. Results: Using synthetic data that mimics Gaia parallax uncertainties and spatial correlations, we observe that our cluster oriented prior families result in distance estimates with smaller errors than those obtained with an exponentially decreasing space density prior. In addition, the treatment of the parallax spatial correlations minimizes errors in the estimated cluster size and stellar distances and avoids the underestimation of uncertainties. Although neglecting the parallax spatial correlations has no impact on the accuracy of cluster distance determinations, it underestimates the uncertainties and may result in measurements that are incompatible with the true value. Conclusions: The combination of prior knowledge with the treatment of Gaia parallax spatial correlations produces accurate (error {\textless}10\%) and trustworthy estimates (i.e. true values contained within the 2\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ uncertainties) of clusters distances for clusters up to {\textasciitilde}5 kpc, and cluster sizes for clusters up to {\textasciitilde}1 kpc.},

	abstract = {Context. The large astrometric and photometric survey performed by the Gaia mission allows for a panoptic view of the Galactic disc and its stellar cluster population. Hundreds of stellar clusters were only discovered after the latest Gaia data release (DR2) and have yet to be characterised. Aims: Here we make use of the deep and homogeneous Gaia photometry down to G = 18 to estimate the distance, age, and interstellar reddening for about 2000 stellar clusters identified with Gaia DR2 astrometry. We use these objects to study the structure and evolution of the Galactic disc. Methods: We relied on a set of objects with well-determined parameters in the literature to train an artificial neural network to estimate parameters from the Gaia photometry of cluster members and their mean parallax. Results: We obtain reliable parameters for 1867 clusters. Our catalogue confirms the relative lack of old stellar clusters in the inner disc (with a few notable exceptions). We also quantify and discuss the variation of scale height with cluster age, and we detect the Galactic warp in the distribution of old clusters. Conclusions: This work results in a large and homogeneous cluster catalogue, allowing one to trace the structure of the disc out to distances of ∼4 kpc. However, the present sample is still unable to trace the outer spiral arm of the Milky Way, which indicates that the outer disc cluster census might still be incomplete. List of cluster parameters and complete list of their members are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/640/A1},

	abstract = {In this study, we follow up our recent paper (Monteiro et al. 2020) and present a homogeneous sample of fundamental parameters of open clusters in our Galaxy, entirely based on Gaia DR2 data. We used published membership probability of the stars derived from Gaia DR2 data and applied our isochrone fitting code, updated as in Monteiro et al. (2020), to GBP and GRPGaia DR2 data for member stars. In doing this, we take into account the nominal errors in the data and derive distance, age, and extinction of each cluster. This work therefore provides parameters for 1743 open clusters and, as a by-product, a list of likely not physical or dubious open clusters is provided as well for future investigations. Furthermore, it was possible to estimate the mean radial velocity of 831 clusters (198 of which are new and unpublished so far), using stellar radial velocities from Gaia DR2 catalogue. By comparing the open cluster distances obtained from isochrone fitting with those obtained from a maximum likelihood estimate of individual member parallaxes, we found a systematic offset of (-0.05 ± 0.04) mas.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We present the third data release of the European Space Agency’s {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} mission, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3. This release includes a large variety of new data products, notably a much expanded radial velocity survey and a very extensive astrophysical characterisation of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} sources.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We outline the content and the properties of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3, providing an overview of the main improvements in the data processing in comparison with previous data releases (where applicable) and a brief discussion of the limitations of the data in this release.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3 catalogue is the outcome of the processing of raw data collected with the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} instruments during the first 34 months of the mission by the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Data Processing and Analysis Consortium.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3 catalogue contains the same source list, celestial positions, proper motions, parallaxes, and broad band photometry in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}BP{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, and {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}RP{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} pass-bands already present in the Early Third Data Release, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} EDR3. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3 introduces an impressive wealth of new data products. More than 33 million objects in the ranges {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}RVS{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} {\textless} 14 and 3100 {\textless} {\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}eff{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} {\textless} 14 500, have new determinations of their mean radial velocities based on data collected by {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. We provide {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}RVS{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} magnitudes for most sources with radial velocities, and a line broadening parameter is listed for a subset of these. Mean {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} spectra are made available to the community. The {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3 catalogue includes about 1 million mean spectra from the radial velocity spectrometer, and about 220 million low-resolution blue and red prism photometer BP/RP mean spectra. The results of the analysis of epoch photometry are provided for some 10 million sources across 24 variability types. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3 includes astrophysical parameters and source class probabilities for about 470 million and 1500 million sources, respectively, including stars, galaxies, and quasars. Orbital elements and trend parameters are provided for some 800 000 astrometric, spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries. More than 150 000 Solar System objects, including new discoveries, with preliminary orbital solutions and individual epoch observations are part of this release. Reflectance spectra derived from the epoch BP/RP spectral data are published for about 60 000 asteroids. Finally, an additional data set is provided, namely the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Andromeda Photometric Survey, consisting of the photometric time series for all sources located in a 5.5 degree radius field centred on the Andromeda galaxy.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} This data release represents a major advance with respect to {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} EDR3 because of the unprecedented quantity, quality, and variety of source astrophysical data. To date this is the largest collection of all-sky spectrophotometry, radial velocities, variables, and astrophysical parameters derived from both low- and high-resolution spectra and includes a spectrophotometric and dynamical survey of SSOs of the highest accuracy. The non-single star content surpasses the existing data by orders of magnitude. The quasar host and galaxy light profile collection is the first such survey that is all sky and space based. The astrophysical information provided in {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3 will unleash the full potential of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater}’s exquisite astrometric, photometric, and radial velocity surveys.},

	abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data processing for which the international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page. http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia},

	abstract = {Context. The census of open clusters has exploded in size thanks to data from the Gaia satellite. However, it is likely that many of these reported clusters are not gravitationally bound, making the open cluster census impractical for many scientific applications. Aims: We aim to test different physically motivated methods for distinguishing between bound and unbound clusters, using them to create a cleaned star cluster catalogue. Methods: We derived completeness-corrected photometric masses for 6956 clusters from our earlier work. Then, we used these masses to compute the size of the Roche surface of these clusters (their Jacobi radius) and distinguish between bound and unbound clusters. Results: We find that only 5647 (79\%) of the clusters from our previous catalogue are compatible with bound open clusters, dropping to just 11\% of clusters within 250 pc. Our catalogue contains 3530 open clusters in a more strongly cut high-quality sample of objects. The moving groups in our sample show different trends in their size as a function of age and mass, suggesting that they are unbound and undergoing different dynamical processes. Our cluster mass measurements constitute the largest catalogue of Milky Way cluster masses to date, which we also use for further science. Firstly, we inferred the mass-dependent completeness limit of the open cluster census, showing that the census is complete within 1.8 kpc only for objects heavier than 230 M⊙. Next, we derived a completeness-corrected age and mass function for our open cluster catalogue, including estimating that the Milky Way contains a total of 1.3 × 105 open clusters, only ∼4\% of which are currently known. Finally, we show that most open clusters have mass functions compatible with the Kroupa initial mass function. Conclusions: We demonstrate Jacobi radii for distinguishing between bound and unbound star clusters, and publish an updated star cluster catalogue with masses and improved cluster classifications.

New objects and new data, in particular, data on kinematics (proper motions) that were not present in the old catalogues, have been included. Virtually all the clusters (1537) presently known were included, which represents an increment of about 347 objects relative to the Lyngå ({\textbackslash}cite\{Lynga1987\}) catalogue. The catalogue is presented in a single table containing all the important data, which makes it easy to use. The catalogue can be accessed on line either at http://www.astro.iag.usp.br/{\textasciitilde}wilton/ or as an electronic table which will be made available at the CDS.

	abstract = {Context. We present the second Gaia data release, Gaia DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system. Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results. Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data products. Results: Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the GBP (330-680 nm) and GRP (630-1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent. Conclusions: Gaia DR2 represents a major achievement for the Gaia mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the Gaia survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.},
